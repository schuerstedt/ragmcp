Create a modern, responsive web section featuring a large, horizontal acronym logo for PIRAGE, with each pillar serving as both a visual element and a text container for explanation.



Grouping logic:



The first group contains “P” (Parse) and “I” (Index). Each letter is inside its own outlined box, but both boxes sit inside a larger dashed or dotted frame in the same color to show they are part of one phase.



The second group contains “R” (Retrieval) and “AG” (Augmented Generation). “AG” is presented as a single, wider box holding both letters, connected visually to “R” inside a larger frame in a second color.



The final pillar “E” (Evaluation) is in its own box in a third color. This color is also used for a large, light outer frame or background that subtly encompasses all three groups, signifying that evaluation ties everything together.



Layout arrangement:



At the top, display the acronym in large, bold, playful lettering inside the grouped frames.



Directly beneath each pillar’s box, provide a heading (e.g., “Parse”) and a short descriptive paragraph. For “AG,” include both words (“Augmented Generation”) under the single shared box.



The layout should maintain the grouping visually — for example, the two boxes in each group stay close together with a shared background panel or border.



Styling guidelines:



Use slightly irregular, dashed or dotted borders with rounded corners for a friendly, hand-drawn feel.



Apply distinct, harmonious colors to each group: one for PI, one for R+AG, and one for E.



Letter typography is large and eye-catching, while pillar descriptions use a clean sans-serif font for readability.



Ensure ample spacing between letters, boxes, and descriptive text for clarity.



Responsive behavior:



On wide screens, display all pillars in a single row under the grouped acronym.



On smaller screens, stack the pillars vertically while keeping their groupings clear with background colors or frames.









P = Parse



I = Index

→ these two go together in one color block.



R = Retrieval



AG = Augmented Generation

→ these two go together in another color block (AG is treated as one pillar with two letters).



E = Evaluation

→ stands alone in its own color, but visually wraps the whole thing as the overarching binder.

The text information for each pillar will follow - just generate some placeholder text. P = Parsing I = Indexing R = Retrieval AG = Augmented Generation E = Evaluation



When doing boxes for the description use 4 boxes for Parse Index Retrieval and Augmented Generation in one row and do a spawning box for Evelauation below. 



PIRAGE is a concept for a full RAG lifecylce, extending the core RAG and bringing the well known parts of a RAG system together.
