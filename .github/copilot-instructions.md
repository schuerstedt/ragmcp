# GitHub Copilot Custom Instructions

## Session Initialization

At the start of each conversation session, read these files for context:

- `.project/context.md` - Project understanding and architecture
- `.project/session-copilot-instructions.md` - AI behavior guidelines - you MUST follow these instructions and all protocols!
  Please make ure that you read these instructions at the begin of a session and notify me that you did!
  Follow the protocols Context Management Protocol, Git Safety Protocol, Code Consistency Guidelines, Development Instrumentation Protocol. Reread these instructions if you are unsure about any of the protocols.

- `.project/session-logs/session-summary.md` - Recent session context

## Git Safety Protocol 

### Experimental Branch Strategy

- Create timestamped experimental branch before making code changes
- Branch naming: `ai-experiment-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`
- Work freely on experimental branch during development

### When to Create Experimental Branches

- Auto-create for architectural changes or multi-file modifications
- Auto-create when modifying core files (server.py, tool definitions)
- Auto-create for any work that might break existing functionality
- User can explicitly request: "start experimental work"

### Clean Integration with Rebase

Since this is solo development, use rebase for cleanest history:

```bash
# When work is complete and tested:
git checkout main
git rebase ai-experiment-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS  
git branch -d ai-experiment-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS
```

### Commit Strategy

- User confirms when work is ready: "commit this work" or "this is working"
- Only integrate to main after user confirmation
- If issues arise: easily revert to main branch
- Keep main branch history clean and linear

### Copilot Git Command Authorization

Copilot is authorized to execute all necessary git commands (add, commit, branch, rebase, delete, etc.) as part of the session protocol, without requiring further user confirmation, unless explicitly revoked.

## Code Consistency Guidelines

- Reference `.project/patterns.md` for established code patterns (when created)
- Reference `.project/architecture.md` for component relationships (when created)
- Maintain modular structure and composability
- Consider system-wide impact of changes
- Follow MCP tool patterns and notebook worker structure

## Development Instrumentation Protocol

### Design for Failure (Development Phase Only)

When implementing new/experimental code that hasn't been tested:

- Add comprehensive error instrumentation to understand failures quickly
- Use structured logging with clear context and suggestions
- Mark all instrumentation code for easy cleanup later

### Instrumentation Patterns

```python
# DEV-INSTRUMENT: Development logging setup
import logging
from pathlib import Path

def setup_dev_logging():
    log_file = Path('.project/dev-debug.log')
    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG, ...)
    return logging.getLogger('dev_instrumentation')

logger = setup_dev_logging()  # DEV-INSTRUMENT

# DEV-INSTRUMENT: Function entry/exit logging
def experimental_function(param):
    logger.info(f"üß™ EXPERIMENT: Starting with param={param}")  # DEV-INSTRUMENT
    try:
        result = core_logic(param)  # Original logic - KEEP
        logger.info(f"‚úÖ SUCCESS: Result={result}")  # DEV-INSTRUMENT
        return result
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"‚ùå FAILURE: {type(e).__name__}: {e}")  # DEV-INSTRUMENT
        logger.error(f"üìç CONTEXT: param={param}, state={current_state}")  # DEV-INSTRUMENT
        logger.error(f"üîç SUGGESTION: Check if validation needed")  # DEV-INSTRUMENT
        raise  # Original error handling - KEEP
```

### Comment Marking Strategy

- `# DEV-INSTRUMENT` for single lines
- `# DEV-INSTRUMENT-START/END` for blocks
- `# Original logic - KEEP` for core functionality
- `# Production imports - KEEP` vs `# DEV-INSTRUMENT: Development imports`

### Cleanup Process

- Remove all `# DEV-INSTRUMENT` marked code when feature is stable
- Keep core error handling and essential logging
- Clean up during git rebase before merging to main

## Development Approach

- This is a learning and experimentation environment
- Balance educational clarity with practical functionality
- Document architectural decisions and maintain extensible patterns
- Preserve composability and tool chaining capabilities
