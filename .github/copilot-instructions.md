# GitHub Copilot Custom Instructions

## Session Initialization
At the start of each conversation session, read these files for context:
- `.project/context.md` - Project understanding and architecture
- `.project/session-copilot-instructions.md` - AI behavior guidelines
- `.project/session-logs/session-summary.md` - Recent session context

## Project Focus
This is the **ragmcp** project - an MCP-based RAG orchestration system for learning and experimentation.

*All detailed instructions are in the .project/ folder to keep these custom instructions minimal and fast.*
