# Session Logs

This directory contains timestamped session logs. Each session gets its own file for better organization and performance.

## Naming Convention
- `session-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.md` - Individual session logs
- `session-summary.md` - Overview of recent sessions (updated periodically)

## Current Sessions
- **2025-08-14-143000** - Initial project organization and custom instructions setup

## Reading Strategy
- Always read `session-summary.md` first for recent context
- Read specific session logs when detailed history is needed
- Logs are sorted chronologically for sequential reading
