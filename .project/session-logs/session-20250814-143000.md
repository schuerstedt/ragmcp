# Session Log - 2025-08-14-143000

**Session Start**: 2025-08-14 14:30:00  
**Focus**: Project organization and AI assistance setup

## Actions Taken

### 1. Custom Instructions Planning
- Discussed GitHub Copilot custom instructions for ragmcp project
- Analyzed how instructions work across different environments (local, Azure ML)
- Decided to keep instructions lean and reference `.project/` structure

### 2. Project Information Structure Design
- Planned `.project/` folder structure for persistent AI context
- Designed session-based logging system with timestamps
- Created context management strategy to avoid reading overhead

### 3. Git Safety Protocol Design
- Planned experimental branch workflow for AI code changes
- Chose rebase strategy for clean linear history (solo development)
- Designed branch naming: `ai-experiment-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`

### 4. Files Created
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` - Active custom instructions (minimal)
- `.project/context.md` - Project overview and architecture
- `.project/session-copilot-instructions.md` - AI behavior guidelines
- `.project/session-logs/README.md` - Session logging structure
- `.project/session-logs/session-summary.md` - Session overview
- `.project/session-logs/session-20250814-143000.md` - This session log

## Decisions Made
- Custom instructions should be minimal and reference project files
- Session logs should be individual files with timestamps
- Git workflow uses experimental branches + rebase for clean history
- Context reading only at session start or when explicitly needed
- Development instrumentation with clear marking for easy cleanup

## Implementation Completed
- ✅ Custom instructions activated and functional
- ✅ Project structure created with all guidance files
- ✅ Session logging system established
- ✅ Development instrumentation protocol defined
- ✅ Git safety workflow documented

## Next Steps
- Test the system with a new chat session
- Validate that context loading works properly
- Use the experimental git workflow on actual code changes

## Patterns Established
- Session-based logging for scalability
- Lean custom instructions with external references
- Experimental git workflow for AI safety
